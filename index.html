            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a PhD student studing biomedical engineering in Shanghai Jiangtong University.</p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I am currently working on tissue engineering and biomaterials.</p>

            <a href="#">Reports: Novel Wound Healing Materials</a>
            <p>Wounds are bothering in our daily life as they cause pain, infection and scars. An ideal wound healing treatment should close the wound rapidly, 
            prevent bleeding or any liquid leakage, inhibit inflammatory to avoid scars, and the whole process should reduce the pain for patients. 
            However,current treatments are far from ideal. Staples and sutures cause pain and cannot stop liquid leakage. 
            Powders and ointment are easily washed away and cannot achieve long-term retention. 
            What is more, the above-mentioned treatments face great challenges for wounds on wet tissue surface, 
            especially for wounds on internal organs like heart, spleen, stomach etc, as adhesion underwater could be challenging.
            </p>
            <p>Here, I propose a photoinitiated, crosslinking hydrogel adhesives for wound repair that is stable in air, anchor firmly onto the tissue surface within 
            seconds and inhibit inflammatory response. The backbone of the hydrogels, cyclic o-nitrobenzyl-modified hyaluronic acid (HA-CNB), has a ring structure in its latent form (i.e. without UV-light irradiation). 
            The UV light acts as scissors, which cut the ring in half, and three active groups are generated, like three hands, with one of them, the aldehyde group, which reacts with the amino groups on proteins in tissue, 
            grabbing the tissue surface firmly to improve adhesion; and the rest two group, thiol and nitroso groups, holding each other to crosslink the network through air insensitive S-nitrosylation. 
            Moreover, high-molecular-weight HA is chosen to promote anti-inflammatory response and M2 cell polarization.</p>
            <p>HA-CNB hydrogels are first used in oral mucosal lesions, because the wet and dynamic environment renders most of the traditional local wound treatment materials ineffective.HA-CNB hydrogels achieved stable and long-term retention on the surface either in artificial saliva or in pig model, 
            thanks to the air insensitive nature of hydrogels and its ability to covalently bond with tissue.</p>
            <p>HA-CNB hydrogels are also tested on incisions from spleen, liver, kidney and heart, and upon light irradiation, HA-CNB hydrogels tightly adhered to incisions on wet surfaces within 5s. Flowing blood showed little effect on the adhesion or hemostasis process on the bleeding kidney, whose incisions could not be closed with sutures. </p>
